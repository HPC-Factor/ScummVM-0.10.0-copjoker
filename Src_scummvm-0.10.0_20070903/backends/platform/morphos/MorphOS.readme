This directory contains the source for the MorphOS port of ScummVM. To build, you
must have a proper Geek Gadgets installation. If you don't have the includes for
Etude and cdda.library, check my webpage. If they aren't uploaded yet, feel free
to e-mail me.

You don't have to build ScummVM yourself. The latest official and CVS binaries are
available from my website at:
